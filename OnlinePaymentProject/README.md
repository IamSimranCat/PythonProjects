# Online Payment project

This project is designed to generate UPI (Unified Payments Interface) QR codes for different payment applications, including PhonePe, Paytm, and Google Pay. The QR codes simplify transactions by allowing users to scan them using their preferred UPI app instead of manually entering payment details.


## Appendix

How it works

1)The user inputs their UPI ID.

2)The program creates UPI payment URLs for PhonePe, Paytm, and Google Pay.

3)It uses the qrcode library to generate QR codes for each platform.

4)The Pillow (PIL) library is then used to display the QR codes.
Users can scan these QR codes to initiate payments directly.
