1) **Introduction to the UPI QR Code Generator Project**
   This project is designed to generate UPI (Unified Payments Interface) QR codes for different payment applications, including PhonePe, Paytm, and Google Pay. The QR codes simplify transactions by allowing users to scan them using their preferred UPI app instead of manually entering payment details.
2) **Project Overview**
   The program takes a UPI ID as input from the user and generates QR codes specific to different payment platforms. The generated QR codes encode the UPI payment URL, making it easier for users to send payments instantly by scanning the code.
3) **How It Works**
   The user inputs their UPI ID.
   The program creates UPI payment URLs for PhonePe, Paytm, and Google Pay.
   It uses the qrcode library to generate QR codes for each platform.
   The Pillow (PIL) library is then used to display the QR codes.
   Users can scan these QR codes to initiate payments directly.
4) **Features**
   Supports multiple payment apps – PhonePe, Paytm, and Google Pay.
   Quick and easy transactions – No need to type UPI details manually.
   Customizable – Users can modify the URL to include additional details like amount, currency, and transaction notes.
   Potential Enhancements
   Allow users to specify an amount and message while generating QR codes.
   Provide an option to save QR codes as images.
   Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.

This project is useful for small businesses, freelancers, and individuals who want a hassle-free way to receive UPI payments with a simple scan!
