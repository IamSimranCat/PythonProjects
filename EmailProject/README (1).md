## Email Validation Script

## About
This project is a simple email validation program written in Python. The script checks if an email entered by the user follows the standard email format and provides feedback if it does not.


## How it works
The program verifies an email by checking:

1)Minimum length (At least 6 characters).

2)Starts with a letter (First character must be alphabetic).
Contains "@" exactly once.

3)Has a valid domain format (Last 3 or 4 characters should include ".").

4)No spaces, uppercase letters, or special characters (except _ @ . ).
